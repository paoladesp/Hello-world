2016.09.26 - Paola, your participation and questions in class are much
appreciated, but at this point you've only submitted one homework. Keep
in mind that even submitting a blank file counts, so please submit them, as
there are only 7 left and you need 6 to pass. That being said, keep asking
questions in class, as you often cut right to the point and others are 
usually having similar issues!
